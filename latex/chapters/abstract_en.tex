\chapter{Abstract}

This study explores how to convert natural language into code to control machines using a Large Language Model (LLM). The research covers background knowledge, literature review, research methods, and experimental design and results.

In the background knowledge and literature review section, we first introduce the current research status of large language models, the application scenarios of smart machines and the Internet of Things (IoT) in artificial intelligence, and the development status of 3D printing technology. We then review the applications of large language models in code generation and machine control, kinematics research, and robot control, as well as the application scenarios of 3D printing in smart machines.

The research methods section describes the hardware design process, including the model design software Autodesk Fusion 360, the file output format STL, the 3D printer Creality K1 MAX, and the introduction of motors and development boards. The kinematics development aspect covers the development of a motion simulation environment, forward kinematics, and inverse kinematics. The section on the selection of large language models includes an introduction to OpenAI and the rules for prompting. Finally, the system architecture section details the system architecture diagram, the input content on the client side, and the process of converting to code.

The experimental design and results section includes three experiments: basic control of the robotic arm, the application of the robotic arm in drawing, and the application of the robotic arm on an automated transport vehicle. This section presents the mechanical structure design diagrams, function design, command format examples, and experimental results.

The experimental results show that using large language models to generate code for controlling machines not only improves the efficiency and accuracy of control command generation but also demonstrates feasibility in various application scenarios. However, as the number of hardware components increases and the system complexity grows, some mechanical errors have been encountered. Future research will continue to optimize the stability and accuracy of the system, further enhancing its application value.
