    abstract = "Recent progress in natural language processing has been driven by advances in both model architecture and model pretraining. Transformer architectures have facilitated building higher-capacity models and pretraining has made it possible to effectively utilize this capacity for a wide variety of tasks. Transformers is an open-source library with the goal of opening up these advances to the wider machine learning community. The library consists of carefully engineered state-of-the art Transformer architectures under a unified API. Backing this library is a curated collection of pretrained models made by and available for the community. Transformers is designed to be extensible by researchers, simple for practitioners, and fast and robust in industrial deployments. The library is available at \url{https://github.com/huggingface/transformers}.",}

  abstract = {Until recently, prototypes had to be constructed by skilled model makers from 2D engineering drawings. This is a time-consuming and expensive process. With the advent of new layer manufacturing and CAD/CAM technologies, prototypes may now be rapidly produced from 3D computer models. There are many different rapid prototyping (RP) technologies available. This paper presents an overview of the current technologies and comments on their strengths and weaknesses. Data are given for common process parameters such as layer thickness, system accuracy and speed of operation. A taxonomy is also suggested, along with a preliminary guide to process selection based on the end use of the prototype.}}
